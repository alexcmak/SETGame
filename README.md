## Math
There is quite a bit of math involved in this deceptively simple game. I have not used any "discrete math" since I studied that in college over 30 years ago. Python is a good choice to write a game like this because it already support "12 choose 3" kind of <i> combination </i> math.


## Future Versions

- improved graphics
- more GUI elements that can provide suggestions.
